## Objective

The "Fishy Phiisshing" project is an ambitious endeavor aimed at unraveling the complexities of real-world phishing attacks. Our journey begins with a rich source of data: a GitHub repository filled with numerous samples of actual phishing emails. Leveraging this repository, our objective is twofold:

1. **Automate Collection**: We will develop a Python script to interact with the GitHub repository's API, automating the process of downloading these phishing email samples for analysis. This not only enhances efficiency but also ensures we have a diverse dataset for a comprehensive study.

2. **In-Depth Analysis**: With a suite of sophisticated tools within a Kali Linux VM, our goal is to dissect these emails meticulously. We'll explore various tactics and characteristics of phishing attempts, using tools like Thunderbird for email analysis, Talos Intelligence and VirusTotal for threat intelligence and link examination, and PhishTool for detailed phishing email investigations.

Our final product will be a detailed phishing report, akin to what a SOC analyst would compile, summarizing our analysis, insights, and recommendations. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of phishing threats and to create educational content to enhance cybersecurity awareness.

## Components

- **VirtualBox**: For creating and managing a secure virtual environment.
- **Kali Linux VM**: A specialized Linux distribution for cybersecurity tasks.
- **GitHub**: Source for phishing email samples, accessed through Python scripting.
- **Python**: Scripting language for automating the fetching of email samples.
- **Thunderbird**: Email client to safely view and analyze phishing emails.
- **Talos Intelligence**: For additional threat intelligence and contextual analysis.
- **VirusTotal**: To analyze suspicious links and attachments for threats.
- **PhishTool**: Specialized tool for detailed phishing email analysis.

  <summary><h2><b>Section 1: Setting Up the Virtual Environment</b></h2></summary>
  This section outlines the initial setup of our Kali Linux virtual machine for the phishing analysis project. We'll begin by updating the system, followed by installing Thunderbird, and ensuring our Python environment is properly configured.

  - **Step 1: Update and Upgrade Kali Linux**:  
    Our first step is to update the Kali Linux system to ensure we have the latest security patches and functionalities.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

  - **Step 2: Install Thunderbird**:  
    Then, we proceed to install Thunderbird, our chosen application for securely managing and viewing phishing emails.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install thunderbird -y
    ```

  - **Step 3: Set Up Python Environment**:  
    Finally, we'll verify that Python is installed and ready, and then set up pip, Python's package manager. We'll also install the 'requests' library, which is crucial for our scripting tasks.
    - Confirm Python installation:
      ```bash
      python3 --version
      ```
    - Install Python if necessary:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install python3 -y
      ```
    - Check pip installation and install 'requests':
      ```bash
      pip3 --version
      pip3 install requests
      ```

  <summary><h2><b>Section 2: Collecting and Analyzing Phishing Emails</b></h2></summary>
  This section focuses on the collection and initial analysis of phishing emails using Python scripts and GitHub. We'll also begin our examination of the emails using Thunderbird and our specialized tools.

  - **Step 1: Fetch Phishing Email Samples**:  
    Use the Python script to automate the downloading of phishing email samples from GitHub.

  - **Step 2: Initial Sorting and Categorization of Emails**:  
    Organize the emails into different categories for a more structured analysis.

  - **Step 3: Conduct Detailed Analysis**:  
    Using Thunderbird, PhishTool, and other tools, start dissecting the emails for phishing indicators and tactics.

  <summary><h2><b>Section 3: Creating Awareness and Educational Materials</b></h2></summary>
  Based on our findings from the analysis, this section will focus on developing educational content to help individuals and organizations recognize and protect against phishing attacks.

  - **Step 1: Compile Findings**:  
    Assemble all documented analysis into a comprehensive format.

  - **Step 2: Develop Educational Content**:  
    Create guidelines, best practices, and other materials using real examples from our analysis.
